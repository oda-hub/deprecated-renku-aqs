# Is this a recommendation engine?

In a way, it is.

However, we try to recommend potentially long combinations of workflows, parameters. 
So the entities which are recommended need to be constructed, chained from individual, existing, pieces. 
In this sense, it is more similar to generation of human-readable sentences: what we get is machine-executable **sentences sequences of steps** (worklows).

**Is text generation a recommendation engine?** Sort of. But it's also more than that.

Since we are parsing reported data and papers and generating new ones, we aim to produce a synthetic sequence of workflow executions:
**build the story of research community reaction to astrophysical events.**
