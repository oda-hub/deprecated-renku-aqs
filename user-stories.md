## Suggesting workflows for new astro users

* I work in some particular domain, e.g. HMXB. I want to start with some example workflow on renku
* I type in a search field HXMB, also see a tag cloud supporting input
* I find a useful workflows analysing NuSTAR data for Cyg X-1 and use it as an example

## Suggesting new workflow runs

* I work on a astronomical workflow: requesting some data with **astroquery**, reducing the data, producing scientific results.
* I want to get some ideas of what to do. Perhaps substitute parts of my workflow (or even whole workflow)
* I get suggestions for new relevant variations of my workflow runs. E.g. I worked with Her X-1, but I could well apply it to V0332.
* Runs are suggested to me, maybe run automatically, I inspect results and expand impact of my workflow


## Helping learn how to build a workflow

* I work on a astronomical workflow: requesting some data from **astroquery**, reducing it, producing results.
* I want to get some ideas of what to do. Perhaps substitute parts of my workflow (or even whole workflow)
* I get suggestions, incorporate them in my work (or use them instead and focus on interpretation)


## New observatory data

* I operate an observatory and recieve new data. Or I ordered observations, they arrived, and I want to analyse them.
* I download the data. I want to find the best tools to reduce them: extract basic products, perhaps some more or less superficial conclusions
* I define my context, and get suggested workflows. Run or adapt them

*Note*: this can be used, for example, in INTEGRAL quick-look activities, with workflows built for [cross-calibration](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1001/contributions/10148/)

## New events published

* New intersting astrophysical event happens, it is reported in papers. It is an HXMB associated with a Neutrino.
* I am interested to derive relevant standard results for this event. I get the suggestions, produce standard results, publish

## New scientific software

* I have produced new scientific software versio
* I want to check it on data where it was previously relevant
* I get suggestions, run them (automatically), compare results with the previous ones

*Note*: this **has been** used in INTEGRAL [cross-calibration activities](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1001/contributions/10148/)


## Ensuring reproducibility by workflow mutation

* I produced some results but they might depend on particular implementation. I want to check if they change when something is changed about the workflow
* I get suggestions for changing parameters: replacing scientific software version
